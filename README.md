# University of Waterloo HTML email system

This is summarized documentation for how to use this HTML email template system. For more information, refer to the documentation in the Documentation folder.


## Layout variations

There are two layout variations available: one column and two column. Each of these layouts has their own available options within. Please keep in mind that all options are meant to be commented or un-commented depending on whether the design calls for them to be used. Be dilligent when adding/removing comment tags so that the overal layout is not adversely affected.

### ONE-COLUMN
This template has options for:
- Additional row of images underneath the hero image.
- Right-aligned body copy inline image
- Left-aligned body copy image
- Button row below body copy

### TWO-COLUMN
This template has options for:
- Left column inline image (full column width)
- Right column right-aligned body copy image
- Right column left-aligned body copy image
- Right column button row below body copy

## Pre-production

Once you have completed building the email you must go through a series of steps to get the code ready to be distributed.

### Inlining CSS
This is the most important step since most email clients do not support linking external stylesheets. There are a number of online inliners but the one we recommend is the [Inky inliner by Zurb](http://zurb.com/ink/inliner.php) since we are also using their Ink email framework to begin with.
